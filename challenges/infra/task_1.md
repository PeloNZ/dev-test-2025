# Task 1

* Demonstrate the steps to configure an environment using Laravel Forge and provision  server for the application

This should be interesting, I haven't used Forge before. To the docs I go...

I'll pretend that I'm going to deploy a fresh app of my own to Forge and I'm writing some quick-and-easy docs for fellow devs to use

## configuration

refer to main docs https://forge.laravel.com/docs/cli

will come back to this one maybe
